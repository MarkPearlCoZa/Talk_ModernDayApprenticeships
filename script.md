I've just had an opportunity to spend a week at 8th Light in Chicago.

# Who are 8th Light?

It is a company founded around the concept of craftmanship. For them craftmanship is about handwork, it's about doing a thing with your hands and seeing the results. Like a carpenter with a saw or a chizzel or a metal worker with a sheet of steel. Their hands are on the material and they are making something with their hands. In software the hands on nature is a little bit more virtual, your hands are on a keyboard, but it is still handwork. 

# Why did I want to go there?

I had heard a talk done by Doug Bradbury at Agile Africa around modern day apprenticeships and what they had been doing at 8th Light. I was fascinated. It was so different from how I had become a professional developer. When I started my career as a software developer I remember pitching up to work the first day, being given a computer and a manual and told here are the specs, solve the problem and that was about it... For the next ten years of my career I made pretty much the same mistakes over and over again. The impression I was given from Doug's talk was that it was different at 8th Light. They were really doing their best to equip people to become good software engineers and so I wanted to find out first if this was just marketing or if they really did this, and if they did what their secret sauce was.

# So how did I get over?

For those that are new, MYOB has the Into Tomorrow competition. Basically the way it works is you come up with an idea or experience that you would not normally have an opportunity to have and then you apply that experience to the Into Tomorrow competition with motivations on how it would help us at MYOB. If you win you get $5000 and 5 days leave to work on your idea. So I won the competition a few months back and that enabled me to setup a trip to Chicago to go and see if 8th Light was the real deal or not.

# How did the week go?

I spent the week setting up sessions with different people at 8th Light. I met with various apprentices to get their take on the experience. Each sesssion would go for about an hour and was based around a series of questions follwed by a discussion. I also met with a mentors, a recent craftsman who had just finished their apprenticeship as well as a director and some of the people involved in in putting the material together. I also spent a morning pairing with one of the apprentices to get a feel for how strong they were technically. I was absolutely blown away by what they have created at 8th Light, and while I don't believe we should copy everything, there are a lot of things they are doing that I believe we would get value from adopting.

# Why apprenticeships?

So let's start with why 8th Light is doing apprenticeships and what they mean by apprenticeship. 

I need to stress this is my own interpretation of why they are doing it, this was not explicityly spoken about with anyone but I believe 8th Light does apprenticeships because

* There is a shortage of professional software developers
* They are highly values driven, and getting a values & technical match is hard. They believe teaching the technical skills is easier to do than to try change someones values.
* They feel that CS grads are overpriced for what they bringing to the table
* They believe in sharing and growing people

# What are do they mean by apprentices?

8th Light has 3 apprenticeship categories although they really only seem to use 2 out of the 3, 

A learner apprentice, a resident apprentice and a journeyman apprentice.

A learner apprentice is someone who will spend 3 months with learning to code. They will have mentors and some material to work through but it is really just an opportunity to give people a chance to see what it is like to be a developer. The apprentice supports themself financially during this time and there is no commitment of employment post the 3 months. This is usually applicable for people who just want to learn more about being a software developer.

A resident apprentice, this is someone with little or no profressional programming experience. They will spend anywhere from 5 months to a year working through 8th Lights apprenticeship program. 8th Light pays them to go through the program, although the payment is just enough to cover your expenses. The aim of the resident apprentice is for them to get to a point where they can graduate, if they are successful they are offered permanent employment at 8th Light as a software craftsman.

A journeyman apprentice, this is someone who has programmed professionally before. They will spend about 3-4 months working their way through the material. Very little was spoken about journeyman apprentices because most of 8th Lights apprentices are learner or resident apprentices. They have found the risk of bringing on journeyman apprentices is fairly high, I think it may be because it is easier teaching a blank slate than someone who already has formed opinions about things.

For the rest of this session I'm going to focus on the resident apprenticeship, although if you have questions regarding the other two I'm happy to answer them in the Q&A at the end.

# Becomming a resident apprentice?

So how do you become an apprentice at 8th Light? They have a set of filters for for identifying apprenticeships. They tend to have a lot of applications, they get about 70 a month, out of which about 2 or 3 will progress to make it in to the resident apprenticeship program. Generally if you make it in to the resident apprentice program you are going to make it through the program.

They look out for a few things:

* They want you to have a love of coding, they look for people that have tinkered before but it is not a requirement. If you have no coding experience you would probably join the learner apprentice to get you to that point.
* They are looking for humble learners. They want people that can take feedback and learn from it. Humility is something you hear a lot of at 8th Light.
* They want people that are hard workers. They expect you to put the hours in and are filtering out people who are 

First they ask for you to write an essay on what craftmanship means to you. This causes a lot of people to drop off but really they are looking for people who are committed. If you are not committed enough to write the essay you are probably not the person they are looking for.

Once they have people that have invested time writing the essay, they give them a problem to solve. Now since most of the people are not professional programmers generally the problem is challenging. A typical example would be to write a console game for a 3 x 3 tic tac toe game. You have as much time as you need to solve the problem. Speaking to the apprentices at 8th Light, many of them invested weeks or months trying to solve this. 

Once you made your submission, they would do a detailed code review. Speaking to the apprentices they were all shocked at how much detail they go in on the submission. You are then given an opportunity to adjust your submission. What they are looking for here are people that are humble learners. If you take offense, or don't make any adjustments you are probably not what they are looking for.
If you are able to take their feedback, and leverage it to improve your submission you are typically considered a good fit and invited to come in for an in person interview. 

The actual in person interview is done by potential mentors. Mentors are existing craftsmen working at 8th Light. Because the mentor / apprentice relationship is so close, they like to match up mentors with apprentices as early on as possible. Mentors actually have to want to help that specific person. Mentors at 8th Light are volunteers. There is no financial reward for it. You do it because you would like to help someone else and because you were helped in the past. Mentors invest a considerable amount of energy into their graduates during the next 6 months.

# Co-mentorship model

It's worth mentioning at this time that at 8th Light they use a co-mentorship model. That means two mentors per apprentice. They found having a co-mentorship model allowed new mentors to get experience mentoring without being left on their own. It also gives them redundancy should someone be under a heavy workload. And it helps having someone you can bounce ideas off on what the apprentice needs to learn.

# What does the apprentice need to learn

This is a good segeway into what are they actually teaching their apprentices? They have a few learning outcomes. Because 8th Light is a consultancy when you become a crafter you can work at a range of clients on a range of technologies. So they can't teach you a specific set of tools. Instead, they aim to teach you a set of paradigms so that regardless of the team or company you work at you can add value from day one.

Right now the outcome of the apprenticeship is that:

* You are comfortable in at least 3 programming paradigms, they want people that are comfortable programming in a functional language, a dynamic language and a staticly typed langauge. Typically if you join and have experience in a certain langauge before you join, they will make sure that during the apprenticeship you don't get to work in that language because they want you to broaden your base. I saw people working in Scala, Ruby, Java, Elixir to name a few.
* You get TDD & design
* You understand how the internet works. One of the challenges they have is to build a http server from scratch in a language where you would get to core principles of how the internet works.
* You can work effectively in groups and pairs.
* You are professional in dealing with clients and communicating and managing expectations.

Before I spent the week at 8th Light I thought they would be learning stuff for the sake of learning, but when visiting I realized there is a certain level of pragmatism. You are not just learning stuff for the sake of learning, you are learning to be able to apply. They are really aiming at you coming out of the apprenticeship as a strong generalist. Once you have that firm foundation you can begin to specialize.

# What is the average day of an apprentice?

The average day of the apprentice is you work on self paced learning. Because all the crafters work at clients, typically you would touch base with your mentors each day via slack, you have a stand up with the other apprentices on what you are working on. Each day i broken up into the following parts

* Morning stand up with other apprentices
* Zagaku session (classroom learning) facilitated by a crafter
* Work on your own

You are left to your own devices to work through your own stuff for most of the day. It's up to you how you manage your time. If you get stuck you can reach out to the other apprentices or to your mentors, Generally if you reach out to your mentor they help you within an hour or two of getting stuck.

Fridays are different at 8th Light to other days. On Fridays all the crafters typically are not at clients but rather come through to the office to spend time "learning" time and to have a meal together. Typically also the apprentices would have a 1 hour session with their mentors each week on their progress and would set clear goals for what they need to accomplish for the next week.

The approach the mentors take is to start out very granular in the breakdown of work with their apprentices. And then as their apprentice becomes comfortable with the work they give it to them in bigger chunks and with less guidance. I see this as an implementation of the Dreyfus model, where if you work with a beginning you need to give recipes. So an apprentice who is very new will have a set of specific technical tasks they need to do, at some point they will progress to more general pieces of work and have to figure out the specifcs on their own.

It is developers who love to write software and who care about high quality code. It is way more than marketing for them. They have a lifelong learning culture.

Apprenticeship program gives them a shared set of virtues and principles. It's a way for them to scale without loosing what makes 8th Light 8th Light.
