I've just had an opportunity to spend a week at 8th Light in Chicago.

# Who are 8th Light?

It is a company founded around the concept of craftmanship. For them craftmanship is about handwork, it's about doing a thing with your hands and seeing the results. Like a carpenter with a saw or a chizzel or a metal worker with a sheet of steel. Their hands are on the material and they are making something with their hands. In software the hands on nature is a little bit more virtual, your hands are on a keyboard, but it is still handwork. 

# Why did I want to go there?

I had heard a talk done by Doug Bradbury at Agile Africa around modern day apprenticeships and what they had been doing at 8th Light. I was fascinated. It was so different from how I had become a professional developer. When I started my career as a software developer I remember pitching up to work the first day, being given a computer and a manual and told here are the specs, solve the problem and that was about it... For the next ten years of my career I made pretty much the same mistakes over and over again. The impression I was given from Doug's talk was that it was different at 8th Light. They were really doing their best to equip people to become good software engineers and so I wanted to find out first if this was just marketing or if they really did this, and if they did what their secret sauce was.

# So how did I get over?

For those that are new, MYOB has the Into Tomorrow competition. Basically the way it works is you come up with an idea or experience that you would not normally have an opportunity to have and then you apply that experience to the Into Tomorrow competition with motivations on how it would help us at MYOB. If you win you get $5000 and 5 days leave to work on your idea. So I won the Into Tomorrow competition a few months back and that enabled me to setup a trip to Chicago to go and see if 8th Light was the real deal or not.



At 8th Light they talk about a humble pursuit of mastery.



It is developers who love to write software and who care about high quality code. It is way more than marketing for them. They have a lifelong learning culture.

Apprenticeship program gives them a shared set of virtues and principles. It's a way for them to scale without loosing what makes 8th Light 8th Light.
