I've just had an opportunity to spend a week at 8th Light in Chicago.

# Who are 8th Light?

It is a company founded around the concept of craftmanship. For them craftmanship is about handwork, it's about doing a thing with your hands and seeing the results. Like a carpenter with a saw or a chizzel or a metal worker with a sheet of steel. Their hands are on the material and they are making something with their hands. In software the hands on nature is a little bit more virtual, your hands are on a keyboard, but it is still handwork. 

# Why did I want to go there?

I had heard a talk done by Doug Bradbury at Agile Africa around modern day apprenticeships and what they had been doing at 8th Light. I was fascinated. It was so different from how I had become a professional developer. When I started my career as a software developer I remember pitching up to work the first day, being given a computer and a manual and told here are the specs, solve the problem and that was about it... For the next ten years of my career I made pretty much the same mistakes over and over again. The impression I was given from Doug's talk was that it was different at 8th Light. They were really doing their best to equip people to become good software engineers and so I wanted to find out first if this was just marketing or if they really did this, and if they did what their secret sauce was.

# So how did I get over?

For those that are new, MYOB has the Into Tomorrow competition. Basically the way it works is you come up with an idea or experience that you would not normally have an opportunity to have and then you apply that experience to the Into Tomorrow competition with motivations on how it would help us at MYOB. If you win you get $5000 and 5 days leave to work on your idea. So I won the competition a few months back and that enabled me to setup a trip to Chicago to go and see if 8th Light was the real deal or not.

# How did the week go?

I spent the week setting up sessions with different people at 8th Light. I met with various apprentices to get their take on the experience. Each sesssion would go for about an hour and was based around a series of questions follwed by a discussion. I also met with a mentors, a recent craftsman who had just finished their apprenticeship as well as a director and some of the people involved in in putting the material together. I also spent a morning pairing with one of the apprentices to get a feel for how strong they were technically. I was absolutely blown away by what they have created at 8th Light, and while I don't believe we should copy everything, there are a lot of things they are doing that I believe we would get value from adopting.

# Why apprenticeships?

So let's start with why 8th Light is doing apprenticeships and what they mean by apprenticeship. 

8th Light has 3 apprenticeship categories although they really only seem to use 2 out of the 3, 

A learner apprentice, a resident apprentice and a journeyman apprentice.

A learner apprentice is someone who will spend 3 months with a co-mentor learning to code. The apprentice supports themself financially during this time and there is no commitment of employment post the 3 months. This is usually applicable for people who just want to learn more about being a software developer.

A resident apprentice, this is someone with little or no profressional programming experience. They will spend anywhere from 5 months to a year working through 8th Lights apprenticeship program. 8th Light pays them to go through the program, although the payment is just enough to cover your expenses. The aim of the resident apprentice is for them to get to a point where they can graduate, if they are successful they are offered permanent employment at 8th Light as a software craftsman.

A journeyman apprentice, this is someone who has programmed professionally before. They will spend about 3-4 months working their way through the material. Very little was spoken about journeyman apprentices because most of 8th Lights apprentices are learner or resident apprentices. They have found the risk of bringing on journeyman apprentices is fairly high, I think it may be because it is easier teaching a blank slate than someone who already has formed opinions about things.

I need to stress this is my own interpretation of why they are doing it, this was not explicityly spoken about with anyone. 


At 8th Light they talk about a humble pursuit of mastery.



It is developers who love to write software and who care about high quality code. It is way more than marketing for them. They have a lifelong learning culture.

Apprenticeship program gives them a shared set of virtues and principles. It's a way for them to scale without loosing what makes 8th Light 8th Light.
