I've just had an opportunity to spend a week at 8th Light in Chicago.

# Who are 8th Light?

It is a software consultancy company founded around the concept of software craftmanship.

So software craftmanship has always resonated with me, but if you asked me to explain it up to now I would have battled. For instance, when we talk about craftmanship it is often explained that craftmanship about handwork, it's about doing a thing with your hands and seeing the results. 

Like a carpenter with a saw or a chisel or a metal worker with a sheet of steel. Their hands are on the material and they are making something with their hands. In software the hands on nature is a little bit more virtual, your hands are on a keyboard, but it is still handwork. Well, that gives me a bit of understanding, but it still seems blury distinguishing the difference between Agile and Software Craftmanship.

And essentially it comes down to culture.

So to buy in to this let me share a model that will help us understand culture better. Now let me highlight that all models are wrong, and some are useful. The Schneider model for cultural compatibility is a useful model.

It maps out four quadrants, Collaboration, Cultivation, Control & Competence.

Collaboration culture is about working together.
Control culture is about getting and keeping control.
Competence culture is about being the best.
Cultivation culture is about learning and growing with a sense of purpose

If I were to map agile out against this model, it would look something like this...

Craftmanship is about technical competency, which sits on the bottom right

# Why did I want to go there?

When I was still living in South Africa I had heard a talk done by a guy called Doug Bradbury who is a director at 8th Light around modern day apprenticeships and what they were doing as a company. I was fascinated. It was so different from how I had become a professional developer. When I started my career I remember pitching up to work the first day, being given a computer and a manual and told here are the specs, solve the problem and that was about it... And for the next ten years of my career I made pretty much the same mistakes over and over again. 

The impression I was given from Doug's talk was that it was different at 8th Light. They had put together a program that could equip people to become great software engineers. I was entrigued enough to want to find out more, really I to figure out if it was just marketing or if they really did this, and if they did what their secret sauce was.

# So how did I get over?

For those that are new, MYOB has the Into Tomorrow competition. Basically the way it works is you come up with an idea or experience that you would not normally have an opportunity to have and then you apply that experience to the Into Tomorrow competition with motivations on how it would help us at MYOB. If you win you get $5000 and 5 days leave to work on your idea. So I won the competition a few months back and that enabled me to setup a trip to Chicago to go and see if 8th Light was the real deal or not.

# How did the week go?

So basically the entire week I just interviewed people.  I set up sessions with different people. I met with apprentices to get their take on the experience. I also met with a mentors, a recent craftsman who had just finished their apprenticeship as well as a director and some of the people involved in in putting the material together. Each interview went on for about an hour and was based around a series of questions followed by a discussion.

I also spent one of the mornings pairing with one of the apprentices to get a feel for how strong they were technically. 

# Why apprenticeships?

So let's start with why 8th Light is doing apprenticeships and what they mean by apprenticeship. 

I need to stress this is my own interpretation of why they are doing it, this was not explicitly spoken about with anyone but I believe 8th Light does apprenticeships because

* There is a shortage of professional software developers
* They feel that CS grads are overpriced for what they bringing to the table
* They believe in sharing and growing people
* They are highly values driven, and getting a values & technical match is hard. They believe teaching the technical skills is easier to do than to try change someones values.

The next thing is that everyone who joins 8th Light goes through an apprenticeship, regardless of past experience. Regardless of whether you have 1 month or 10 years software development experience, you go through their program. The difference is how fast.

They have 3 categories of apprenticeships.

A learner apprentice, a resident apprentice and a journeyman apprentice.

A learner apprentice is someone who knows nothing about programming and is just wanting to find out if this is something they want to pursue further. They will spend 3 months learning to code. They will have mentors and some material to work through. They support themself financially during this time and there is no commitment of employment from 8th Light. 

A resident apprentice, is someone who knows how to code but has little or no professional programming experience. They will spend anywhere from 5 months to a year as an apprentice. 8th Light pays them to go through the program, although the payment is just enough to cover your living expenses. The aim of a resident apprentice is to graduate, if you are successful you are offered permanent employment at the end of the apprenticeship as a crafter at 8th Light.

A journeyman apprentice, is someone who has programmed professionally before. They typically spend about 3-4 months working their way through the material. Most of 8th Lights apprentices are learner or resident apprentices as they have found the risk of bringing on journeyman apprentices is fairly high. To put it another way, it is easier teaching a blank slate than someone who already has formed opinions about things and has bad habits.

For the rest of this session I'm going to focus on the resident apprenticeship, although if you have questions regarding the other two I'm happy to answer them in the Q&A at the end.

# Applying to be a resident apprentice

So how do you become an apprentice at 8th Light? 

From 8th Lights side it's all about filters. They have a set of filters for for identifying good candidates. They tend to have a lot of applications for the program, less than 1% of people make it through their filters to enter the program.

They look out for a few things:

* They want you to have a love of creating software, they look for people that have tinkered before but it is not a requirement. 
* They are looking for humble learners. They want people that can take feedback and learn from it. Humility is something you hear a lot of at 8th Light.
* They want people that are hard workers. They expect you to put the hours in and are filtering out people who don't

First they ask for you to write an essay on what craftmanship means to you. They are looking for people who put effort into this, because if you are not going to put effort into writing the essay, you probably aren't serious about the program.

Once they have people that have invested time writing the essay, they give them a problem to solve. Generally the problem is challenging. They have found with time instead of giving someone a blank solution, they give them a partially implemented solution and ask them to fix the bugs.  You have as much time as you need to solve the problem. Speaking to the apprentices, many of them invested weeks or months working on their submission. 

Once you made your submission, they do a detailed code review. This is where having provided a partial solution helps since often it is easier to review. Speaking to the apprentices they were all shocked at how much detail they got back from their submission. You are then given an opportunity to adjust your submission. What they are looking for here are people that are humble learners. If you take offense, or don't make any adjustments you are probably not what they are looking for. If you are able to take their feedback, and leverage it to improve your submission you are  invited to come in for an in person interview. The actual in person interview is done by potential mentors. 

It's worth mentioning at this time that at 8th Light technical mentorship is the key to their success. Mentors at 8th Light are existing crafters who volunteer their time. There is no financial reward for it. You do it because you would like to help someone else and because you were helped in the past. Mentors invest a considerable amount of energy into their apprentices. When an apprentice starts they and their mentor sign a contract. In writing, both the apprentice and the mentor willingly agree to devote the time and energy required to make the apprenticeship a success.

Through the years they have progressed to a co-mentorship model. That means two mentors per apprentice. They found having a co-mentorship model allowed new mentors to get experience mentoring without being left on their own. It also gives them redundancy should someone be under a heavy workload. And it helps having someone you can bounce ideas off on what the apprentice needs to learn.

# What does the apprentice need to learn

This is a good segway into what are they actually teaching their apprentices? They have a few learning outcomes. Because 8th Light is a consultancy when you become a crafter you can work at a range of clients on a range of technologies. So they can't teach you a specific set of tools. Instead, they aim to teach you a set of paradigms so that regardless of the team or company you work at you can add value from day one.

Right now the outcome of the apprenticeship is that:

* You are comfortable in several programming paradigms, they want people that are comfortable programming in a functional language, a object oriented language , a dynamic language and a statically typed language. Typically if you join and have experience in a certain language before you join, they will make sure that during the apprenticeship you don't get to work in that language because they want you to broaden your base. I saw people working in Scala, Ruby, Java, Elixir to name a few.
* You get TDD & design
* You understand fundamentally how the internet works. 
* You can work effectively in groups and pairs.
* You are professional in dealing with clients and communicating and managing expectations.

Before I spent the week at 8th Light I thought they would be learning stuff for the sake of learning, but when visiting I realized there is a certain level of pragmatism. You are not just learning stuff for the sake of learning, you are learning to be able to apply. They are really aiming at you coming out of the apprenticeship as a strong generalist. Once you have that firm foundation you can begin to specialize but throughout the apprenticeship you are forming the foundation.

# What is the average day of an apprentice?

The average day of the apprentice is you work on self paced learning. Because all the crafters work at clients, typically you would touch base with your mentors each day via slack, you have a stand up with the other apprentices on what you are working on. Each day is broken up into the following parts

* Morning stand up with other apprentices
* Zagaku session (classroom learning) facilitated by a crafter
* Work on your own stuff

You are left to your own devices to work through your own stuff for most of the day. It's up to you how you manage your time. If you get stuck you can reach out to the other apprentices or to your mentors, Generally if you reach out to your mentor they help you within an hour or two of getting stuck.

So that's a normal day at 8th Light as an apprentice.

Fridays are different at 8th Light to other days. On Fridays all the crafters typically are not at clients but rather come through to the office to spend time "learning" time and to have a meal together. Typically also the apprentices would have a 1 hour session with their mentors each week on their progress and would set clear goals for what they need to accomplish for the next week.

The approach the mentors take is to start out very granular in the breakdown of work with their apprentices. And then as their apprentice becomes comfortable with the work they give it to them in bigger chunks and with less guidance. I see this as an implementation of the Dreyfus model which is a model that is very useful for growing people, the Dreyfus model says that if you work with a beginner you need to give specific recipes on what to do. So with an apprentice who is very new you will give them a set of specific technical tasks to do in a week, as they become comfortable with doing those tasks you move it up an abstraction level to give them more general pieces of work. They do this to teach you how to work with customers. Ultimately they want you to be comfortable hearing the problems people have and be able to figure out how to solve them instead of being told what solution to do and so the next 6 months is growing their apprentices to reach this level.

# What sort of problems does an apprentice work on?

I really liked how 8th Light approaches this. They pick problems that have almost universal domain knowledge to start off with. Apprentices work on kata's, but kata's are often small problems that one can solve in a couple of hours. The real work they have is bigger problems. A classic one at 8th Light is the Tic Tac Toe problem. This is a problem they use for people applying to join the mentorship program, it is also a problem they iterate on several times during their apprenticeship because you can adjust the problem statement to learn different design principles.

So an example of adjusting the problem as someone grows would be to, implement tic tac toe in a console on a 3 x 3 matrix, then refactor your code to handle a 4 by 4 matrix. 
* Now implement it in a functional language, 
* Now implement the engine to play against a computer. 
* Now implement it to utilize tail call optimization and so on. 
* Now expose the game as a service
* Now put a web front end over it

And so on, the benefit 8th Light has of having a problem like this is that everyone knows the problem, and it is complex enough that you can make it non trivial if you want but also start beginner off with is, which means most people can help apprentices and look at someones code and see where they are struggling without having to figure things out on your own.

Another problem that apprentices solve closer to the end of their apprenticeship that seems to be a real hit is to build a http server from scratch. They do this because they feel once you have built a http server from scratch many of the mysteries of the internet resolved. The best analogy I can think of is once you have taken your car's engine apart and put it back together again you are probably not so scared to tinker with your car. All the apprentices also said this was the most challenging problem they had to solve and one they enjoyed the most.

Apart from development work, there are three other areas that people focus on. Everyone at 8th Light is encouraged to blog in some form. Most put out a blog at least every few weeks. They are encouraged to put their learnings in their blog posts. They see this as a way of closing the loop for blogging. They are also encouraged to present sessions, either as lightening talks or talks - the benefit of this is when you are working with clients, you should be comfortable presenting work to your clients. They also have some required reading.

Personally this is something that I'm really passionate about, a lot of the secrets to software development is hidden in books. At 8th Light they really encourage people to read books. In fact as you walk around the office you find these book cases filled with great books. It is something I would love to see us adopt more than we have already.

Now that I've gone through some of the problems they solve, let's talk about how you progress from an apprentice to a crafter.

# How to progress from apprentice to crafter

The process of becoming a crafter is based on competency. As I said, there is no set time period, they expect most people to be ready to try graduate within 6 months to a year. When mentors feel an apprentice is getting close to being ready they set up a pairing tour. They identify other 6 other people they would like to be involved in the review process and the apprentice pairs/shadows each person for a week or two before going into the graduation review period.

The test involves a 2 week period of intensified challenges. The apprentice is given a problem at the beginning of the two weeks, they have 2 weeks to deliver an appropriate solution. At the end of the two weeks the 6 people and their two mentors get together to review the work of the apprentice. They present the problem they are solving, the approaches they took. Each person does a detailed review of their submission. They have a detailed conversation with the group on why they took certain approaches. All in all the meeting with the "quorum" takes a day. At the end of the quorum gets together to discuss where they feel the apprentice is ready.

The two weeks is intense. Speaking to crafters, most of them spend 80+ hours a week to solve the problem in time. It is not trivial. I could not find out what problem they solve since nobody would talk about it. But it is seen as an achievement if you are successful.

The last day I was at 8th Light they had an apprentice that had just graduated. They got the whole company together, the mentor stood up in front of the entire group and at the top of his voice welcomed their newest crafter to 8th light. I don't know if it was just an American thing, but there was real cheering and applause. It felt like this was seen as a major achievement.

# Feedback along the way

There are a few concerns that apprentices have around graduation. For many of them this is the opportunity to get permanent employment. They are worried if they go to the two week period and are not ready they will loose the one chance they have. To reduce the chances of this happening they now have a 3-4 month mini review done with their mentors and 2 other people, just so that there are no surprises by the time the apprentice hits the 2 week period. 

# Benefits

So what were the benefits I saw at 8th Light:

Firstly, being able to take someone who has no professional programming experience and in about a 6 month period being able to grow them to the point where they are at the level they are is amazing. I came out of the experience saying it is possible to do this. 

Secondly, as an organization 8th Light has plugged into a market for developers that nobody else is tapping. Most of the people working at 8th Light would never have been able to get work as a professional developer anywhere else because they simply did not have the experience. As an organization, being able to say we can take you because you have the right mindset, even if you currently don't the technical expertise, allows you to focus on putting people first.

Thirdly, having seen technical mentorship in action I see what an impact this has. There is something about helping someone else become awesome that is extremely fulfilling. I believe that embracing technical mentorship at MYOB would be a big step forward for us. Growing technical skills should not just be a conversation that you have with your dev lead. 

# Challenges

Now let's talk about some of the challenges you could face. 

There is a concern about how these various filters removes some of the diversity that other companies would have. For instance, having to work 160 hours over a two week period may make it hard for certain people to work their way through the program. It may not be an option you are single parent.

What's you career path after you become a crafter? 8'th Light has a clear vision of reaching the level of crafter, but it isn't so clear after that. I know they are aware of this

Another challenge that they have found is that because their people become technically strong, and there is a shortage of strong technical engineers other companies love to poach 8th Lighters if they can. A

# In closing

Apprenticeship program gives them a shared set of virtues and principles. It's a way for them to scale without loosing what makes 8th Light 8th Light. Are there any questions?
